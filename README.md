# simple-Online-Bookstore-in-cpp
Online Bookstore: Using a binary search tree (BST) for this bookstore app, we can efficiently handle operations like searching, inserting, deleting, and updating books. The books will be stored in a binary search tree based on a specific key (for example, book title). Each node could represent a book and contains information of the book (title, author, etc).
